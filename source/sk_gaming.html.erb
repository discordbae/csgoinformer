            FalleN is well known within the CS:GO community as one of the best
            In Game Leaders in the world. He has led his team to victory in 3
            major titles, as well as numerous smaller tournaments. Even more
            impressive is that FalleN manages this while also consistently
            maintaining a position at the top of the scoreboard as one of the
            top AWPers.

            Fer, like most players on the SK team, has been part of the group
            since before their time playing under the Luminosity Gaming banner
            even. His primary role is entry fragging, meaning he usually leads
            the charge and looks for opening kills. He has an incredible ability
            to open up rounds for his team by overrunning defenders holding a
            bomb site.

            Coldzera has also been with SK Gaming since before their time
            playing for the Luminosity Gaming organization. He is widely
            regarded as one of the best all around players in the world. He is
            incredibly versatile, playing equally well as a rifler or AWPer,
            and can often be found out fragging everyone on the server.

            fnx is the one of SK Gaming's primary riflers. The earliest
            championship he won in his Counter Strike career was ESWC in 2006
            at a young age. His teams dominated in Brazil and he ultimately
            joined the rest of the guys when they played as Luminosity Gaming.
            He always plays the lurker role, meaning when his team attacks a
            place on the map, he's hanging back trying to flank around behind
            the enemy team.

            TACO is another of SK Gaming's primary riflers, meaning his primary
            role is eliminating the enemy team. The challenge in this role for
            many players is consistency. However, TACO always seems to step up,
            escpecially when the pressure is on in clutch situations. It's not
            uncommon to see him win 1v2, 1v3, or even 1v4 scenarios in
            tournaments, often turning an entire game around for his team.
